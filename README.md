# Mail-Matcher

With the rise of modern media and new, faster forms of communication, it is increasingly easy to make social connections.

However, this inflation of social relationships comes with a major downside: decreased quality of relationships.  Flashy pictures and fancy instagram filters only exacerbate the problem, putting the focus on beauty and looks, as opposed to emotional and intellectual camaraderie.

My approach to the problem is a radical restructuring of the match making process.  Rather than allowing the user to make multiple superficial matches in seconds, Mail Matcher automatically matches two people once a week, through email.  

Not only is email a largely textual medium, it is much slower (One match per week aside), and forces users to value the connections they make, and invest energy into them.
